# Python Address Book

Design-only questions:

Q: Find person by email address (can supply any substring, ie. "comp" should work assuming "alexander@company.com" is an email address in the address book) - discuss how you would implement this without coding the solution.

A: This could be easily achieved by changing the regex expression used in the AddressBook.__emailMatch function.
